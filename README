InfoSys
=======
This is a system to keep track of as much data as possible
for a role-playing convention. It is based on the needs of
one such convention (Fastaval in Denmark) but might have a
use for a wider audience - hence it's opensource.

Requirements
============
PHP 5.6
- xml
- mbstring

Mysql 5.5/5.7
