<h2>Reminder of payment for Fastaval <?=$this->year?></h2>

<p>Hi <?= e($this->participant->fornavn);?> <?= e($this->participant->efternavn);?>,</p>

<p>
    We&#39;re writing to you because we haven&#39;t registered a payment from you for Fastaval <?=$this->year?>, and so
    we thought we&#39;d take the opportunity to remind you.
</p>

<p>If you already paid, just ignore this email - we are just lagging a bit behind getting our information up-to-date.</p>

<p>
    If you haven&#39;t already paid, remember that your deadline for paying is <?=$this->payment_day_en;?>.
    If you don&#39;t pay by this date your registration will be canceled.
</p>


<p>The amount is <strong><?=$this->payment_remainder?></strong> DKK,</p>
<p>
    When paying remember to clearly state your name and participant ID which is :
    <strong><?=$this->participant->id?></strong>
</p>

<p>
    If you're using the Danish MobilePay, you can transfer the money to 438490 (Alea).<br>
    It's important that you pay from the same number as the one you entered during sign-up. If this isn't possible,
    please email <a href=mailto:andreas@fastaval.dk>andreas@fastaval.dk</a> and we'll figure something out.
</p>

<p>
    You can also pay right away by using Paypal. Transfer to <a href="mailto:andreas@fastaval.dk.">andreas@fastaval.dk.</a>
    There is a 100DKK fee for paying with PayPal so you will need to transfer a total of 
    <strong><?=($this->payment_remainder + 100)?></strong> kr.
</p>

<h4>Payment by banktransfer</h4>
<p>
    If you cannot pay using one of the above methods, it is also possible to pay through banktransfer. This is a bit
    more expensive however, as it involves more work. Because of that, there is a fee of <?= e($this->banking_fee);?>DKK
    on bank transfers. Also be aware that there are usually an extra fee on international bank transfers.
    <b>All fees incurred on international transfers will be your responsibility</b>.</br>
</p>

<p>To pay by banktransfer, use the information below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Payment due is <?= e($this->payment_remainder + floatval($this->banking_fee));?>DKK
        (<?= e($this->payment_remainder);?>DKK + <?= e($this->banking_fee);?>DKK fee)
    </li>
    <li>From a Danish bank: Reg.: 9070 / Account: 1638710893</li>
    <li>Our bank information is IBAN DK1090701638710893 and BIC VRAADK21.</li>
    <li>
        ALWAYS make sure to add your name and participant ID <strong><?=$this->participant->id?></strong> as message so
        we know who the payment was from
    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We look forward to seeing you at Fastaval <?=$this->year?>!</strong></p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Fastaval</p>
