<h2>Reminder of payment for Fastaval <?=$this->year?></h2>

<p>Hi <?= e($this->participant->fornavn);?> <?= e($this->participant->efternavn);?>,</p>

<p>
    We&#39;re writing to you because the deadline for paying for Fastaval <?=$this->year?> has passed and we haven&#39;t
    registered a payment from you. If you have already payed, please contact <a href=mailto:andreas@fastaval.dk>andreas@fastaval.dk</a>
    so we can properly register your payment.
</p>

<p>
    If you had ordered any wear, this has been removed from your sign-up. You do however still have time to pay for any
    food you&#39;ve ordered, if you pay before Mar 21, <?=$this->year?>. If you haven't payed by this date, we will
    remove any food orders from your sign-up.
</p>

<p>The amount is <strong><?=$this->payment_remainder?></strong> DKK,</p>
<p>
    When paying remember to clearly state your name and participant ID which is :
    <strong><?=$this->participant->id?></strong>
</p>

<p>
    If you're using the Danish MobilePay, you can transfer the money to 438490 (Alea).<br>
    It's important that you pay from the same number as the one you entered during sign-up. If this isn't possible,
    please email <a href=mailto:andreas@fastaval.dk>andreas@fastaval.dk</a> and we'll figure something out.
</p>

<p>
    You can also pay right away by using Paypal. Transfer to <a href="mailto:andreas@fastaval.dk.">andreas@fastaval.dk.</a>
    There is a 100DKK fee for paying with PayPal so you will need to transfer a total of 
    <?=($this->payment_remainder + 100)?> kr.
</p>

<h4>Payment by banktransfer</h4>
<p>
    If you cannot pay using one of the above methods, it is also possible to pay through banktransfer. This is a bit
    more expensive however, as it involves more work. Because of that, there is a fee of <?= e($this->banking_fee);?>DKK
    on bank transfers.
</p>

<p>To pay by banktransfer, use the information below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Payment due is <?= e($this->payment_remainder + floatval($this->banking_fee));?>DKK
        (<?= e($this->payment_remainder);?>DKK + <?= e($this->banking_fee);?>DKK fee)
    </li>
    <li>From a Danish bank: Reg.: 9314 / Account: 4573884464</li>
    <li>Our bank information is IBAN DK6693144573884464 and BIC SPNODK22.</li>
    <li>
        ALWAYS make sure to add your name and participant ID <strong><?=$this->participant->id?></strong> as message so
        we know who the payment was from
    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We look forward to seeing you at Fastaval <?=$this->year?>!</strong></p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Fastaval</p>
