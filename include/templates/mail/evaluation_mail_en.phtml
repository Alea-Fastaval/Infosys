    <h2>Hey <?=$this->name?>!</h2>

    <p>
      A thousand, thousand many thanks from the bottom of our heart for your participation in Fastaval 2024 - and throw
      in another thousand thanks if you were an organizer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this mail you'll find a link to the evaluation of this year's Fastaval, and we would be so happy if you would
      spend a few moments answering it, so that we can further optimise Fastaval in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      The evaluation only takes approx. 5 min. To answer and is split into different categories regarding the different
      things Fastaval has to offer.
    </p>

    <?php if (isset($this->info['work_area'])) { ?>
    <p>
      As an organizer we have a few questions regarding your work at Fastaval. Afterwards you will be introduced to the
      same questions as the other participants.<br> 
      Therefore the questionnaire can seem a bit longer for the organizers, but the first half is very important to us!
