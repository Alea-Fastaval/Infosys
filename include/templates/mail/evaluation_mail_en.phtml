<h2>Hey <?=$this->name?>!</h2>

<p>
  A thousand, thousand many thanks from the bottom of our heart for your participation in Fastaval 2023 - and throw in
  another thousand thanks if you were an organizer.
</p>

<p>
  In this mail you'll find a link to the evaluation of this year's Fastaval, and we would be so happy if you would spend
  a few moments answering it, so that we can further optimize Fastaval in the future.
</p>

<p>
  The evaluation only takes approx. 5 min. To answer and is split into different categories regarding the different
  things Fastaval has to offer.

<p>
  As an organizer we have a few questions regarding your work at Fastaval. Afterwards you will be introduced to the same
  questions as the other participants.<br> 
  Therefore the questionnaire can seem a bit longer for the organizers, but the first half is very important to us!
